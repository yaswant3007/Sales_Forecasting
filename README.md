**Classification Metrics Interpretation:**

Precision: 0.7507
Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions. A high precision score indicates the model's effectiveness in correctly predicting high sales when it makes such predictions. This is particularly crucial for identifying successful promotional events or periods.

Recall: 0.6049
Recall measures the model's ability to capture positive instances. While the recall score suggests room for improvement in capturing all high-sales periods, the model shows promise in identifying such periods effectively.

Accuracy: 0.5529
Accuracy reflects the overall correctness of the model's predictions. While slightly above 50%, indicating that the model performs better than random guessing, there is potential for further enhancement in its ability to generalize across all data points.

**Regression Metrics Interpretation:**

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 14694.81
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 622,700,057.79
R-squared (RÂ²): -17.66

The model's predictive errors, while present, can be addressed through ongoing refinement and optimization. Despite these challenges, the model's precision in classification remains a valuable asset for identifying successful sales periods and guiding promotional strategies effectively.
